A budgeting tool I made to help me figure out where my money goes each month.

## What it does

You put in your income and it breaks down how much you should put toward rent, food, savings, and bills. Pretty straightforward.

## How to use it

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Pick if you get paid fortnightly or monthly
3. Type in your income
4. Change the percentages if you want
5. Hit calculate and you're done

## Features

* Choose your pay schedule
* Adjust budget percentages however you want
* See exactly how much goes where
* No installation needed, just works in your browser

Made this because I got tired of doing the math every time.
